# GAM-244-Final-Superhot-Miami
Superhot / Hotline Miami crossover

To run build of the game, download and extract the zip file containing the executable, then run the included exe.

Features:
1. Standard Gun and Ricochet Gun (LMB to shoot RMB to throw)
2. Standard Shotgun Enemy based on build
3. Dynamic vision/flashlight
	-Subfeature: entities that are not solid structures of the map are only visible when within player's FOV.
4. REM Ability: Press 'Shift' to use. When avtivated, the player's FOV is expanded to see all around for 5 seconds before returning to normal. The player starts with a set amount visible in the top left corner, and gains one additional use after passing each level.
5. HUD/Score: A hud is provided showing the number of REMs available and a score from killing enemies. With some variance, the most points are gained by meleeing enemies, a little less from shooting them, and a little less from throughing your weapon at them. Score is carried between levels and resets to what the player had at the start of the room upon death.
6. Refrigerator Ninja: These are essentially normal refrigerators that act as a square piece of wall that absorbs shots and acts as an obstacle. However, each refrigerator could potentially be hiding a melee enemy inside! If the player is nearby and isn't looking at the refrigerator (not in FOV), the enemy that's hiding inside will take the opportunity to jump out and attack the player almost immediately. Be careful!

Difficulty:
The game starts pretty easy and becomes rather difficult in the middle. The difficulty then lets up a little bit to give the player a break before ramping it up drastically in the last two stages. ALL stages are beatable with practice. I have personally beaten all of them multiple times (although the last level can take quite a while). Good luck have fun!
